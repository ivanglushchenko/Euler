Euler
=====

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems) is a list consisting of more than 400 mathematical problems. Some are easy, some are not, and you are welcome to solve any of them in any order you like.

This project contains my solutions for these problems. The main goals of the project are

1.  To have fun and study something new in the process (like the number theory)
2.  I don't care very much about running time as long as it doesn't exceed one minute. 
2.  I usually try not to use brute force search, looking instead for a (often) smartypants solutions. Why? Because 1) and 2) of course!
