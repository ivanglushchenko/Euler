Euler
=====

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a list consisting of more than 400 mathematical problems. Some are easy, some are not, and you are welcome to solve any of them in any order you like.

This project contains my solutions for these problems. The main goal is to have fun, which means I don't care very much about running time as long as it doesn't exceed one minute.
